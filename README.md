# illuminated_flowerpot

Illuminated Flowerpot is a small home project that helps herbs and vegetables grow indoors by providing gentle, configurable light. The current build focuses on simple, reliable lighting control. Configuration will be handled via a Bluetooth SPP module, and a future ESP32‑C3 Zero version is planned with a web-based configuration panel.
